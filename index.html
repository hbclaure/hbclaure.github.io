	<p class="lead">Welcome! I am <span itemprop="name">Houston Claure</span></p>
	<p>and I am a <span itemprop="title">postdoc at Yale University</span> in the <span itemprop="title">Computer Science Department</span>. My interest lie in the field of <span itemprop="title">human-robot interaction(HRI)</span>, <span itemprop="title">human-computer interaction(HCI)</span>, and <span itemprop="title">artificial intelligence</span>. In my research, I look to developing algorithmic and design solutions that allow robots allocate both physical resources(materials, tools, etc.) as well as social resources(attention, gaze) while considering human notions of fairness. Specifically, I am using reinforcement learning and machine learning techniques to develop algorithms to enhance human-robot teams. I am also interested in the design of robotic systems capable of thriving in spaces inhabited by humans. I am working with <a href="https://www.marynel.net/">Dr. Marynel VÃ¡zquez</a> in the <a href="https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io/">Interactive Machines Group (IMG)</a>.

	I obtained my Ph.D. from Cornell University in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I was advised by Dr. Malte Jung and worked in the Robots in Groups Lab.I was also the founder of Vida, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create solutions that support teachers struggling with remote teaching during this COVID-19 lockdown. Our proposal for Vida was funded by the National Science Foundation(NSF) I-Corp grant.
