	<p class="lead">Welcome! </p>
	<p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Houston Claure</span> and I am a <span itemprop="title">postdoc at Yale University</span> in the <span itemprop="title">Computer Science Department</span>. I work in the <a href="https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io">Intelligent Machines Group (IMG)</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.marynel.net">Dr. Marynel VÃ¡zquez</a>. My research is driven by the vision of a future where robots that collaborate alongside humans can make decisions that implement human notions of fairness. For instance, how can a robot embedded within a team consider fairness and team performance when it distributes resources amongst team members of different skill levels? By equipping robots with the ability to recognize and predict unfair actions, we can enhance their effectiveness as collaborators, improving cohesion and performance in diverse group settings such as hospitals, schools, and homes. My work sits at the crossroads of <span itemprop="title">human-robot interaction (HRI)</span>, <span itemprop="title">human-computer interaction (HCI)</span>, and <span itemprop="title">artificial intelligence (AI)</span>.</p>
	<p>I received my <span itemprop="title">Ph.D.</span> from <span itemprop="title">Cornell University</span> in the Sibley School of <span itemprop="title">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</span>. I was advised by <a href="https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/">Dr. Malte Jung</a> and worked in the <a href="https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/riglab/">Robots in Groups Lab</a>. Additionally, I founded Vida, a company leveraging AI to assist teachers with remote teaching challenges during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our work at Vida was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps grant. I have also interned at the Toyota Research Institute.</p>
	<p>I am on the academic job market this year. Please reach out if you think there is a fit!</p>
