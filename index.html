	<p class="lead">Welcome! </p>
    <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Houston Claure</span> and I am a Computational Social Scientist, working at the intersection of  <span itemprop="title">human-robot interaction (HRI)</span>, <span itemprop="title">human-computer interaction (HCI)</span>, and <span itemprop="title">artificial intelligence</span>.  I am currently a <span itemprop="title">postdoc at Yale University</span> in the <span itemprop="title">Computer Science Department</span>. I work in the <a href="https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io">Intelligent Machines Group (IMG)</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.marynel.net">Dr. Marynel VÃ¡zquez</a>. In my research, I look to develop solutions that will allow AI agents to behave in morally appropriate ways. I also  focus on understanding how an AI agent's fairness (or unfairness) affects the ways that humans behave towards one another.</p>  
	<p>I receieved my <span itemprop="title">Ph.D.</span> from <span itemprop="title">Cornell University</span> in the Sibley School of <span itemprop="title">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</span>. I was advised by <a href="https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/">Dr. Malte Jung</a> and worked in the <a href="https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/riglab/"> Robots in Groups Lab</a>. I was also the founder of Vida, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create solutions that support teachers struggling with remote teaching during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our proposal for Vida was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corp grant. </p>

I am also interested in the design of robotic systems capable of thriving in spaces inhabited by humans. </p> -->
