{% include preview="ilanfig.png" title="Algorithmic Fairness in Human-Robot Interaction"  description="In this work we use reinforcement learning as a means to  integrate robots into human teams consisting of two or more people.  In our first project we developed a method to explore resource distribution between a robot and human team members. The second project includes using our developed multi-armed bandit(MAB) algorithm to have a system adapt and regulate its allocation of resources. Additionally, I explored how perceived fairness influences a team member's performance within the group."%}
